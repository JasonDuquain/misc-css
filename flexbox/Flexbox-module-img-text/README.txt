A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/dudleystorey/pen/qqLxMz.

 A quick experiment in balancing text and images: the photos will _always_ fill the left side of the module from top to bottom, shrinking and expanding with the horizontal size of the responsive container _and_ with changing amounts of content. (You can experiment with this by adding and removing from the paragraph in each box.)
